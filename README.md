## Goal:

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.
Use AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.

## Display the following under current weather conditions:
* City
* Date
* Icon image
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Wind speed
* UV index

### Include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast should display the following:

* Date
* Icon image
* Temperature
* Humidity

## To Do:
Include a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name should perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city.
